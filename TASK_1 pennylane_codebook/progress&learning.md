We successfully completed codebooks on introduction to quantum computing, single qubit gates, and multi-qubit circuits within a two-week timeframe.

However, we encountered significant challenges understanding PennyLane's Python library due to its poorly structured documentation.

Solving programming problems with PennyLane's often brief documentation proved to be quite difficult.

Despite these obstacles, we gained valuable problem-solving skills in quantum computing.

We strongly recommend that PennyLane's documentation be restructured for better accuracy and coherence.
